# Azure MCP Connector - Quick Deployment Guide

A simple, containerized Azure MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that you can deploy to Azure App Service with just a few clicks.

The application is designed to run the MCP server as a child process and proxy requests to it, providing a stable, containerized environment for the service.

## Overview

This project provides a containerized and cloud-ready deployment of the Azure MCP server, allowing remote connections while maintaining the simplicity of the original `@azure/mcp` package. The solution acts as a proxy that forwards all queries to the official Azure MCP server without reinventing authentication or core functionality.

## What is Azure MCP Server?

The Azure MCP Server enables AI agents and other types of clients to interact with Azure resources through natural language commands. It implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide these key features:

- **MCP support**: Works with MCP clients such as GitHub Copilot agent mode, the OpenAI Agents SDK, and Semantic Kernel
- **Entra ID support**: Uses Entra ID through the Azure Identity library to follow Azure authentication best practices
- **Service and tool support**: Supports Azure services and tools such as the Azure CLI and Azure Developer CLI (azd)

The Azure MCP Server implements a set of tools per the Model Context Protocol, allowing AI agents and other clients to interact with Azure resources using natural language. For example, you could use GitHub Copilot agent mode with the Azure MCP Server to list Azure storage accounts or run KQL queries on Azure databases.

For more information, see the [Azure MCP Server documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/overview).

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you can deploy the MCP connector, you need to set up Azure authentication. This is a **required first step**.

### Step 1: Create Azure Service Principal

The MCP server needs to authenticate with Azure. You'll need to create a Service Principal:

1. **Open Azure CLI** (install from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) if needed)

2. **Login to Azure**:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

3. **Create Service Principal**:
   ```bash
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "AzureMCPConnector" --role "Contributor"
   ```

4. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Save the credentials!** 
   
   The command will output something like this:
   ```json
   {
     "appId": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
     "displayName": "AzureMCPConnector",
     "password": "your-secret-password",
     "tenant": "87654321-4321-4321-4321-210987654321"
   }
   ```
   
   **You MUST save these values - you cannot retrieve the password later!**
   
   - `appId` → **AZURE_CLIENT_ID**
   - `password` → **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET**  
   - `tenant` → **AZURE_TENANT_ID**
   - Your **AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID** (get it with `az account show --query id --output tsv`)

5. **Get your Subscription ID**:
   ```bash
   az account show --query id --output tsv
   ```

> **💡 Alternative: Using Azure Portal**
> 
> If you prefer to create the Service Principal using the Azure Portal GUI:
> 1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) → Azure Active Directory → App registrations
> 2. Click "New registration"
> 3. Name: "AzureMCPConnector"
> 4. Select "Accounts in this organizational directory only"
> 5. Click "Register"
> 6. Note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**
> 7. Go to "Certificates & secrets" → "New client secret"
> 8. Add description and set expiration, then click "Add"
> 9. **Copy the secret value immediately** (you won't see it again)
> 10. Go to "API permissions" → "Add permission" → "Azure Service Management" → "Delegated permissions" → "user_impersonation"
> 11. Click "Grant admin consent"
> 12. Go to "Enterprise applications" → find your app → "Assign users and groups" → add yourself with "Contributor" role

## 🚀 Deploy to Azure

Now that you have your Azure credentials, you can deploy the MCP connector:

### Option 1: One-Click Deployment (Recommended)

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fshaikhanwar%2Fazmcp-deploy%2Fmain%2Fbicep%2Fazmcpconnector.bicep)

1. Click the "Deploy to Azure" button above
2. Fill in the required information:
   - **Resource Group**: Choose an existing one or create new
   - **Web App Name**: Choose a unique name for your app
   - **Docker Image**: `shaikhanwar/azmcpconnector:latest` (pre-filled)
   - **Azure Credentials**: Use the values you saved from Step 1:
     - **Tenant ID**: Your AZURE_TENANT_ID
     - **Client ID**: Your AZURE_CLIENT_ID  
     - **Client Secret**: Your AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
     - **Subscription ID**: Your AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
3. Click "Review + Create" and then "Create"
4. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually or need to customize the deployment:

```bash
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group "your-resource-group" \
  --template-file bicep/azmcpconnector.bicep \
  --parameters webAppName="your-app-name" \
  dockerImage="shaikhanwar/azmcpconnector:latest"
```

## 📱 Connect Your MCP Client

Once deployed, configure your MCP client (like VS Code) to connect:

### VS Code Configuration
Add this to your VS Code settings (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)"):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "Azure MCP": {
        "url": "https://your-app-name.azurewebsites.net/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `your-app-name` with the actual name you used during deployment.

## ✅ Verify Deployment

1. **Check the app is running**: Visit `https://your-app-name.azurewebsites.net/health`
2. **Test MCP connection**: Try connecting from your MCP client
3. **Check logs**: In Azure Portal → App Service → Log stream

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify these critical settings in Azure Portal:

### Environment Variables
Go to App Service → Configuration → Application settings and ensure:

| Variable | Value | Required |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `WEBSITES_PORT` | `80` | ✅ Yes |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Your Service Principal Client ID | ✅ Yes |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Your Service Principal Client Secret | ✅ Yes |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Your Azure Tenant ID | ✅ Yes |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Your Azure Subscription ID | ✅ Yes |

### Port Configuration
- **Only set `WEBSITES_PORT` to `80`** (remove any custom `PORT` setting)
- This ensures Azure routes traffic correctly to your container
- Port 80 is the standard for HTTP and recommended for production

### VS Code Configuration
Add this to your VS Code settings (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)"):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "Azure MCP": {
        "url": "https://your-app-name.azurewebsites.net/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `your-app-name` with your actual App Service name.

## ��️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App returns 503 errors:**
- Check that all Azure credentials are correctly set
- Verify the Service Principal has Contributor permissions
- Check the log stream for detailed error messages

**Can't connect from MCP client:**
- Ensure you're using the correct URL format: `https://your-app-name.azurewebsites.net/mcp`
- Check that CORS is properly configured
- Verify the app is running (check health endpoint)

**Authentication errors:**
- Double-check your Service Principal credentials
- Ensure the Service Principal hasn't expired
- Verify the subscription ID is correct

### Getting Help

- **Logs**: Check Azure Portal → App Service → Log stream
- **Health Check**: Visit `/health` endpoint for status
- **SSH Access**: Enable SSH in App Service settings for debugging

## 📋 What Gets Deployed

This deployment creates:
- **Azure App Service**: Hosts your MCP connector
- **App Service Plan**: Provides compute resources
- **Application Insights**: Monitoring and logging
- **All necessary configuration**: Environment variables, health checks, etc.

## 🏥 Health Check Configuration

The deployment automatically configures health checks for high availability:

- **Health check:** Enabled
- **Health probe path:** `/health`
- **Unhealthy instance removal:** 10 minutes (default)

**To verify in Azure Portal:**
- Go to App Service → Monitoring → Health check
- Ensure health check is enabled with path `/health`

The app implements a lightweight `/health` endpoint that returns `200 OK` when the service is running properly.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Service Principal credentials are stored securely in Azure Key Vault
- The app runs in a container with minimal permissions
- All traffic is encrypted with HTTPS
- CORS is configured for security
